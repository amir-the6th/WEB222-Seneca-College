          <dfn id="ISS">The <b>International Space Station</b></dfn> 
          (<abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr>) 
          is a spacecraft, a laboratory, and more importantly, a multi-nation construction
          project. It is like a luxurious home in the space; up to 10 astronauts are hosted in 
          <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr>
          at any one time. This so-called home is an advanced scientific laboratory that NASA is
          using in order to learn more about living and working in space. A variety of 
          <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/"> scientific experiments</a>
          are being conducted on the International Space Station every day.

      </div>

      <div id="construction">
        <h2>Construction</h2>
        <p>
          To construct this station, sixteen countries contributed: The United States, Russia, Canada,
          Japan, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden,
          Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. 
          <br><br>
          The <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> was launched 21 years ago, on <time datetime="1998-11-20">20 November of 1998</time> 
          and has been inhabited since <time datetime="2000-11-02">November second, 2000</time>. It circles the Earth in low Earth orbit, that means it flies 250 miles above Earth's surface.
          <br><br>
          Although the main construction of the station ended in <time>2011</time>, it is continuously evolving to include new missions.

        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p>
          The effort that was put into this project by these 16 countries resulted in a soccer field-sized spacecraft that is 
          <data>109 meters long</data> and <data>73 meters wide</data>. Not forget to mention, the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr>
          is the largest man-made object in the universe. With the speed of <data>7.66 km/s</data>, 
          the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> can orbit the entire plane every 90 minutes.

        <p>
          As of <time>June 2020</time>, according to NASA, 241 individuals from 19 countries have visited the International Space Station. 
          The list of the names of the people and the countries can be found

          It is worthy to note that the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> is the most expensive thing

          Some quick, fun, and interesting <mark>facts</mark> about the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr>:

          <ol type="I">
            <li>
              There are only two bathrooms on the entire football field-sized station
            </li>
              <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                <li>The crewmembers filter back their urine and also the laboratory animals' into the drinking water supply</li>
              </ul>

            <li>Normally, space shouldn't smell like anything; though, the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr>, 
              according to an <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> astronaut, smells like metallic-ionization, 
              and therefore, is considered the first place that you can actually smell space in
            </li>

            <li>
              The <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> is the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and Venus. 
              I will explain this more in the next sections
            </li>

            <li>
              In order to stay in-shape while on-board the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr>, the astronauts 
              must work out at least for two hours per day to maintain the standards of Earth-based living
            </li>

            <li>
              It's funny to know how astronauts tackle the daily tasks:
            </li>
              <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>Crewmembers float across the station when dining. they don't have any dining table or chair; 
                  they have got to stabilize themselves and eat slowly so the food wouldn't float and run away
                </li>
                <li>
                  All the food is packaged, dehydrated, or canned so it doesn't need refrigeration and it is also easier to maintain and manage
                </li>
                <li>
                  Crewmembers attach vacuum cleaner to their hair shavers so the hair won't float after getting cut. 
                  Here's a fun video regarding this fact:

        <h2>How to see the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr></h2>
        <p>
          Some may think that the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> cannot be seen without telescope; the truth is, 
          it is one of the easiest objects to spot in the night sky. It looks like a fast-moving airplane when you see it.
          <blockquote>
            The space station is visible because it reflects the light of the Sun – the same reason we can see the Moon
            <cite><a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/faq.cfm">NASA</a></cite>
          </blockquote>
          There are many websites and applications that you can get notified on when you can spot the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> with unaided eyes. 
          <a href="https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">NASA’s Spot the Station website</a> is a service that texts you when the 
          <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> will over your location.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also brought you the Spot the Station widget so you don't have to go and check the website: <br>

        </p>
        <p id="live-feed">  
          <br><br> There is also a live video feed of the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> that points towards Earth 
          for the times you want to see the opposite view, which is from the <abbr title="International Space Station">ISS</abbr> looking down to the Earth: <br><br>
