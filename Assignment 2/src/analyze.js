/*******************************************************************************
 * Part 2: using our cases functions to write an analysis program.
 *
 * Welcome to Assignment 2 Part II! In this second part of the assignment, you're
 * going to be using the functions you wrote in cases.js to create a simple
 * command line program that can do analysis on COVID cases in Toronto.
 *
 * This time, we won't use unit tests.  Instead, you will be asked to use
 * the functions you already wrote (and know are working thanks to the tests)
 * to complete the following program.
 *
 * This program allows the user to do an analysis of case data for FSA,
 * Neighbourhood, or all data.  The user decides how much data to analyze by
 * including command line arguments
 *
 * To see an analysis of all data, you would do:
 *
 *    npm run analyze
 *
 * To see an analysis of the MJ6 forward sortation area (FSA), you would do:
 *
 *    npm run analyze -- --fsa="MJ6"
 *
 * To see an analysis of the data with 'park' in the Neighbourhood Name, you would do:
 *
 *    npm run analyze -- --neighbourhood="park"
 *
 * Most of the program is written below, but it needs you to fix the parts that
 * are indicated with TODO in the comments.
 *
 *  - getCasesByFSA()
 *  - getCasesByNeighbourhood()
 *  - getAgeGroupSummary()
 *
 * They have been included below from `cases.js`, so you don't need to rewrite them.
